RVNC - A vnc connection wrapper for remote.it showing use of the client-side daemon for a P2P connection.
------------------------------------------
This software allows you to make P2P connections to your remote.it enabled vnc servers.

Your username and password will be stored in ~/.remoteit/auth.  In the event of a "102] login failure" error, delete this file and try again.

To get a list of all VNC services associated with your account, use:

./rvnc.sh -l

To make a VNC connection to any given service, use:

./rvnc.sh service-name

service-name is the name you gave to this VNC application's remote.it Service.

If your service name has spaces in it, surround "service name" with quotes.

Verbose output

To get more information about the internal operation of the script, use one or two -v switches, e.g.

./vnc w.sh -v service-name

./rvnc.sh -v -v service-name

Clearing the cache

To clear out all cached data (port assignments, service list)

./rvnc.sh -r

Connection times may be a little slower and you may get connection security warnings after doing this 
until all services have been connected to once.

To cleanup (reset login authorization and active port assignments)

./rvnc.sh -c

After running this, you will need to log in again.

How the script works

The script starts by logging into the remote.it server to obtain a login token.  All API calls are 
documented here:

https://docs.remote.it/api-reference/overview

The user token is sent to the Service List API call in order to retrieve the full device list 
associated with this account.

From there we parse the JSON output of the device list and find the entry corresponding to the device 
name you gave.  We find the UID (JSON ["deviceaddress"]) for this entry and use this in conjunction 
with the remote.it daemon (connectd) in client mode to initiate a peer to peer connection.

/usr/bin/connectd -c <base64 of username> <base64 of password> <UID> T<portnum> <Encryption mode> <localhost address> <maxoutstanding>

-c = client mode
<base64 of username> = remote.it user name, base64 encoded
<base64 of password> = remote.it password, base64 encoded
<UID> = remote.it UID (deviceaddress metadata) for this remote.it Service
<portnum> = port to use on localhost address
<Encryption mode> = 1 or 2
<localhost address> = 127.0.0.1
<maxoutstanding> = 12

Example:
/usr/bin/connectd -c ZmF1bHReaX5lMTk9OUB5YWhvby5jb20= d5VhdmVkFjAxWg== 80:00:00:0F:96:00:01:D3 T33000 1 127.0.0.1 12

Now you have a listener at 127.0.0.1:33000 that allows a connection to your remote device's VNC service.

This P2P connection will remain active until you hit the Enter key, at which point the connection daemon is terminated.
